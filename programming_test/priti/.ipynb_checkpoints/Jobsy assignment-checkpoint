1.Write a function that returns the maximum of two numbers.

def maximum(first, second):
    if first > second:
        return first
    else:
        return second


first = int(input("Enter first number:"))
second = int(input("Enter second number:"))

result = maximum(first, second)

print("maximum is:", result)

2.Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.
If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
Otherwise, it should return the same number.

def fizz_buzz(number):
    if number%3 == 0:
	    return Fizz
    elif number%5 == 0:
	    return Buzz
    elif number%3 == 0 & number%5 == 0:
	    return FizzBuzz
    else:
	    return number


number = int(input("Enter the number:"))
result = fizz_buzz(number)

print(result)	


3.Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed.
If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”

def speed(speed):
d = 0
if speed <70:
    print("ok")
elif speed == 70 and speed % 5 == 0:
    demerit += ((speed – 75) / 5) + 1
    print(“Demrit points: “,d)
elif d >= 12:
    print(“License is suspended”)	
else:
    print("No driver")
	

	
4.Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print all the numbers between
0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:
0 EVEN
1 ODD
2 EVEN
3 ODD

def shownumber(limit):
    for i in range(0, limit):
        if i==0:
            print(i)
            print("EVEN")
        elif i%2==0:
            print(i)
            print("EVEN")
        
        else:
            print(i)
            print("ODD")

a = int(input("enter the number:"))
print(shownumber(a))


5.Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter).
For example, if the limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20.

def calculate_sum(a, N): 
    m = N / a 
    sum = m * (m + 1) / 2
    ans = a * sum
  
    print("Sum of multiples of ", a, 
          " up to ", N, " = ", ans) 
  
calculate_sum(3, 20)


6.Write a function called show_stars(rows). If rows is 5, it should print the following:
*
**
***
****
*****

n = int(input("Enter the number of rows"))  
for i in range(0, n):
    for j in range(0, i + 1):  
        print("* ", end="")       
    print()  
	
	
7.Write a function that prints all the prime numbers between 0 and limit where limit is a parameter.

n=int(input("Enter the limit: "))
primes = []
for i in range (2, n+1):
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i%j == 0:
            break
    else:
        primes.append(i)
print(primes)
