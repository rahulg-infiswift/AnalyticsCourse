The 2020 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament held from 31 July to 16 August 2020 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. It was originally scheduled to take place from 18 April to 4 May, but qualification and the main rounds were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The event was intended to allow limited live audiences, but apart from the first day and the final it was played behind closed doors. The tournament was organised by the World Snooker Tour, broadcast by the BBC, Eurosport and Matchroom Sport, and sponsored by sports betting company Betfred. It had a total prize fund of £2,395,000, with the winner receiving £500,000. The delayed qualifying rounds took place from 21 to 28 July, involving 128 professional and invited amateur participants. The top 16 reached the main stage of the tournament where they played the top 16 ranked players. Judd Trump, the defending champion, lost in the quarter-final stage to Kyren Wilson. Ronnie O'Sullivan (pictured) won his sixth world title, defeating Wilson 18–8 in the final.
